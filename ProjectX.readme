  Kurz:         Universeller Dateiöffner für Amiga Workbench mit DefIcons

  ProjectX is a universal file opener for Amiga Workbench that allows you to
  set a single DefaultTool on project icons, which then dynamically determines
  and launches the appropriate application based on the file type.

  Features:
  - Works as a universal DefaultTool for any project file type
  - Automatically identifies file types using icon.library and DefIcons
  - Looks up DefaultTools from DefIcons def_XXX.info files
  - Launches applications in Workbench mode using the Workbench API (OpenWorkbenchObjectA)

  Requirements:
  - AmigaOS 3.2 or higher (requires icon.library V47+ with ICONGETA_IdentifyBuffer and requester.class)
  - DefIcons 47.8 or higher (for file type identification)

  Usage:
  ProjectX is designed to be set as the DefaultTool on project icons. When you
  double-click a project file that has ProjectX as its DefaultTool, ProjectX
  will:

  1. Identify the file type using DefIcons
  2. Look up the corresponding def_XXX.info icon in ENV:Sys/ or ENVARC:Sys/
  3. Extract the DefaultTool from that icon
  4. Launch the tool with the project file

  Setup:
  1. Copy ProjectX to SYS:C/ or your preferred location in a Path that Workbench will find
  2. Open the Information window for any project icon
  3. Set "ProjectX" as the DefaultTool
  4. Double-click the project icon to launch it with the appropriate tool

  How It Works:
  ProjectX solves the problem of hardcoded DefaultTools in project icons.
  Instead of each project icon pointing directly to its application (which
  breaks when files are moved or tools are relocated), ProjectX acts as an
  intermediary that:

  - Uses DefIcons' file type identification to determine what kind of file it is
  - Looks up the user's preferred tool for that file type from DefIcons'
    def_XXX.info files
  - Launches that tool using the Workbench API, passing the project file

  This allows you to:
  - Share project files without worrying about tool paths
  - Change your preferred tool for a file type system-wide
  - Use different tools for the same file type in different workflows
  - Have a single DefaultTool setting that works for all file types

  DefIcons Integration:
  ProjectX relies on DefIcons for file type identification. DefIcons must be
  running and configured with rules for the file types you want to use with
  ProjectX. The def_XXX.info icons in ENV:Sys/ or ENVARC:Sys/ must have a
  DefaultTool set.

  Examples:
  - Set ProjectX as the DefaultTool on a text file icon
    → ProjectX identifies it as "ascii" type
    → Looks up def_ascii.info and finds "TextEdit" as the DefaultTool
    → Launches TextEdit with the text file

  - Set ProjectX as the DefaultTool on an image file icon
    → ProjectX identifies it as "png" type
    → Looks up def_png.info and finds "MultiView" as the DefaultTool
    → Launches MultiView with the image file

  Limitations:
  - If the def_XXX.info that matches does not have a default tool, but the parent file type does, currently 
  ProjectX has no way to find the parent file type and look for a DefaultTool in the parent icon instead
  - Requires DefIcons to be running
  - The def_XXX.info icon must therefore exist in ENV:Sys or ENVARC:Sys and have a DefaultTool set
  - Requires AmigaOS 3.2 or 4.1 as it requires DefIcons and the latest versions of icon.library and workbench.library
